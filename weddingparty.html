As Allie famously said when I married her lovely older sister, Jessi...I am the brother she &quot;never wanted but always had!&quot; She delivered that Maid-of-Honor speech with confidence and punch when she was only 17. And she may not have realized it at the time, but that quote so aptly describes our relationship. As the youngest of four boys, I never had a younger sibling to pick on, much less a younger sister! Allie, you were the unfortunate victim of circumstance! Kidding aside, I felt instantly comfortable with Allie, as so many do. She has a gift. She is hilarious, self-deprecating, fun, disarming, thoughtful, generous, and kind--a genuinely great person. Yes, she may be completely unstable on ice and oddly afraid of seagulls, but let's not draw attention to that. She has been at the center of so many wonderful and momentous memories in my life, but also at the center of simple text messages with video links to silly humor. I am eternally thankful to call her &quot;Sis&quot;, to have her as an amazing and loving Aunt to my children (and God Mother to one), and that she ultimately found a partner cut from the same quality material. Matt, I'm honored to be your groomsman and can't wait be your brother-in-law. Wishing you both a life of love and happiness.";

			  			var bodytext = "The first recollection I have of meeting Matt was in pre-school.  We stood next to each other singing &quot;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&quot; in a Christmas musical performed in front of our close friends and family.  Matt's falsettos were better than average for his age so I was greatly impressed, especially when paired with my legato we sounded heavenly. At that moment I knew we would be very close friends the rest of our lives.  Matt and I stayed in close contact through middle school and high school and when I was unexpectedly accepted into Penn State's Main Campus, of which Matt had been accepted for months at this point, Matt was the first person I called.  We roomed together throughout college where we shared advancement in academia and dipsomania.  After graduating college we parted ways but always stayed in close contact. When I moved back to Pittsburgh, PA one of the first people to come and visit me was Matt....and he brought his girlfriend Allie. The first time I met Allie it couldn't have been a better atmosphere. Allie was an Ohio State grad and her alma mater was heavily favored to win the 2013 Big 10 Championship against Michigan State which we would all watch together that evening. My wife and I had just got our first puppy so spirits were high all around despite Penn State's irrelevance at this point of the season.  The funny part about that night was not how Michigan State ended up upsetting Ohio State in the championship game or how many times our new puppy peed on the floor every time a touchdown was scored and someone cheered. The funny part was how Matt consoled his crying girlfriend after the heart breaking Ohio State loss. Matt had put aside his distain for Ohio State to care for someone greater than the petty college rivalry that had meant so much to us before.  At that moment I knew Matt and Allie were perfect for each other and they would both be there for one another through anything. Love you guys, all the best.";

			  			var bodytext = "I feel like it's rare that you can remember the first time you saw someone that isn't a romantic connection, but I can vividly recall when I first saw Slocum with Matt Daniels at a bus stop waiting to go to frats during the first few days at Penn State - you couldn't miss this odd couple. Soon, Slocum was my pledge class president as we pledged at Sig Chi. Little did I know then just how much this guy would change my life...I owe my marriage to him. He helped to set me up with my now wife way back during our Freshman year of college. Stacy and I were both too shy to make a first move, but Slocum the social butterfly had no problem getting us to hang out more often and exchange AOL instant messenger screen names.<br/><br/>Fast forward nine years and Slocum and his then girlfriend Allie were the first of our friends to come visit us in Pittsburgh after the birth of our first child. Not surprising in the least - that is just the type of guy and friend that he is.<br/><br/>During that nine year time gap, there were countless hilarious moments, hundreds of hours of aimless chatting (a few were actually serious), and lots and lots of beer. But best of all, I became lifelong friends with a guy who is always genuine and caring, and is sometimes funny.<br/>  <br/>Best wishes Allie and Matt, and thanks for letting me be part of your celebration.";

A more in depth summary of this encounter is available in paperback at your local book stores.<br/><br/>We later decided to pledge the fraternity, and Matt was nearly unanimously elected to be our pledge class president. I say nearly, because I voted for Peaches. Matt did an ok job, though.<br/><br/>The first time I saw Allie and Matt interact together, playful banter abounding, I could tell they were right for each other.  I wish them the very best in their future together.<br/>";

			  			var bodytext = "Matt and I met as children.  He's my cousin!  And we had a childhood full of rollerblading, going to the local candy store.  We went to summer camp where Yohoo brought us closer.  Matt introduced me to his friends.  It was a great way to make a summer vacation pass.  Being from New Hamshire, and a deadset Capitals fan, ... just don't tell anyone from Boston.  Allie and I might have met for a quick beer before I watched the Caps snuff the Bruins playoff hopes in 2011.<br/><br/>My game was always baseball, and Matt and I, when not terrorizing the neighborhood on wheels played at the Mount Penn &quot;A&quot; field.  I miss the Sycamore in the front of the house, and the converted garage-turned-playroom.  When Matt came to New Hampshire, we probably played in the back yard. My earliest memory of Allie is her recording of Matt doing the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.  Her comment caption was, &quot;wet teeshirt contest.&quot;  This moment explains my love for Her.  An indefatigable ability to shred my cousin with humor, say something everyone might be thinking, and make it rain on him. <br/>";

Throughout high school we were teammates on the soccer team, teammates on the tennis team and even made a run for the county title in doubles together eventually losing in what I remember as epic fashion. <br/><br/>We both decided to go to Penn State and Matt was the one that talked me into joining the sigma chi fraternity our first semester at school. While that decision may not have been the best decision for my grades it certainly was the best decision in terms of the amount of fun we had in college. Matt was obviously mostly responsible for a lot of that fun whether it was running the entire fraternities social calendar to acting as master DJ for every single get together I ever showed up to in college.  There are not many great memories from college and high school that do not involve Matt in one way or another. <br/><br/>Matt and I have become even better friends since high school and college and I am always looking forward to the next big golf weekend or ski trip or whatever Matt is planning with all of our friends. <br/><br/>I first met Allie at dinner in D.C. Where my wife and I joined a bunch of our other friends for dinner including Matt and Allie.  Everyone that knows my wife knows that she has been friends with Matt even longer than I have and when we knew we were going to be meeting matts new girlfriend we were ready to test her for sure. It was obvious that Allie was pretty awesome and we instantly thought she was great. Throughout the time we lived in D.C. We spent a lot of time with Matt and Allie and have always had a great time.  It's obvious that Allie cares a great deal for her family and friends since  her and Matt were some of the first few people to visit us all the way from D.C. After each of our kids was born. <br/><br/>I am happy to be one of matts groomsman and am looking forward to a great party!";
