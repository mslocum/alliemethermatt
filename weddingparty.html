				var bodytext = "It's hard to believe I met Allie when she was 13 years old--more than half her life ago. As Allie famously said when I married her lovely older sister, Jessi...I am the brother she &quot;never wanted but always had!&quot; She delivered that Maid-of-Honor speech with confidence and punch when she was only 17. And she may not have realized it at the time, but that quote so aptly describes our relationship. As the youngest of four boys, I never had a younger sibling to pick on, much less a younger sister! Allie, you were the unfortunate victim of circumstance! Kidding aside, I felt instantly comfortable with Allie, as so many do. She has a gift. She is hilarious, self-deprecating, fun, disarming, thoughtful, generous, and kind--a genuinely great person. Yes, she may be completely unstable on ice and oddly afraid of seagulls, but let's not draw attention to that. She has been at the center of so many wonderful and momentous memories in my life, but also at the center of simple text messages with video links to silly humor. I am eternally thankful to call her &quot;Sis&quot;, to have her as an amazing and loving Aunt to my children (and God Mother to one), and that she ultimately found a partner cut from the same quality material. Matt, I'm honored to be your groomsman and can't wait be your brother-in-law. Wishing you both a life of love and happiness.";

				case 'Matt Daniels':
				var bodytext = "The first recollection I have of meeting Matt was in pre-school.  We stood next to each other singing &quot;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&quot; in a Christmas musical performed in front of our close friends and family.  Matt's falsettos were better than average for his age so I was greatly impressed, especially when paired with my legato we sounded heavenly. At that moment I knew we would be very close friends the rest of our lives.  Matt and I stayed in close contact through middle school and high school and when I was unexpectedly accepted into Penn State's Main Campus, of which Matt had been accepted for months at this point, Matt was the first person I called.  We roomed together throughout college where we shared advancement in academia and dipsomania.  After graduating college we parted ways but always stayed in close contact. When I moved back to Pittsburgh, PA one of the first people to come and visit me was Matt....and he brought his girlfriend Allie. The first time I met Allie it couldn't have been a better atmosphere. Allie was an Ohio State grad and her alma mater was heavily favored to win the 2013 Big 10 Championship against Michigan State which we would all watch together that evening. My wife and I had just got our first puppy so spirits were high all around despite Penn State's irrelevance at this point of the season.  The funny part about that night was not how Michigan State ended up upsetting Ohio State in the championship game or how many times our new puppy peed on the floor every time a touchdown was scored and someone cheered. The funny part was how Matt consoled his crying girlfriend after the heart breaking Ohio State loss. Matt had put aside his distain for Ohio State to care for someone greater than the petty college rivalry that had meant so much to us before.  At that moment I knew Matt and Allie were perfect for each other and they would both be there for one another through anything. Love you guys, all the best.";

				case 'Matt Davis':
				var bodytext = "I feel like it's rare that you can remember the first time you saw someone that isn't a romantic connection, but I can vividly recall when I first saw Slocum with Matt Daniels at a bus stop waiting to go to frats during the first few days at Penn State - you couldn't miss this odd couple. Soon, Slocum was my pledge class president as we pledged at Sig Chi. Little did I know then just how much this guy would change my life...I owe my marriage to him. He helped to set me up with my now wife way back during our Freshman year of college. Stacy and I were both too shy to make a first move, but Slocum the social butterfly had no problem getting us to hang out more often and exchange AOL instant messenger screen names.<br/><br/>Fast forward nine years and Slocum and his then girlfriend Allie were the first of our friends to come visit us in Pittsburgh after the birth of our first child. Not surprising in the least - that is just the type of guy and friend that he is.<br/><br/>During that nine year time gap, there were countless hilarious moments, hundreds of hours of aimless chatting (a few were actually serious), and lots and lots of beer. But best of all, I became lifelong friends with a guy who is always genuine and caring, and is sometimes funny.<br/>  <br/>Best wishes Allie and Matt, and thanks for letting me be part of your celebration.";

				case 'Benjamin Levine':
				var bodytext = "I met Matt in the Fall of '04 at the sigma chi fraternity house.  A more in depth summary of this encounter is available in paperback at your local book stores.<br/><br/>We later decided to pledge the fraternity, and Matt was nearly unanimously elected to be our pledge class president. I say nearly, because I voted for Peaches. Matt did an ok job, though.<br/><br/>The first time I saw Allie and Matt interact together, playful banter abounding, I could tell they were right for each other.  I wish them the very best in their future together.<br/>";
				break;
				case 'Chadd Hippensteel':
				var bodytext = "Matt and I met as children.  He's my cousin!  And we had a childhood full of rollerblading, going to the local candy store.  We went to summer camp where Yohoo brought us closer.  Matt introduced me to his friends.  It was a great way to make a summer vacation pass.  Being from New Hamshire, and a deadset Capitals fan, ... just don't tell anyone from Boston.  Allie and I might have met for a quick beer before I watched the Caps snuff the Bruins playoff hopes in 2011.<br/><br/>My game was always baseball, and Matt and I, when not terrorizing the neighborhood on wheels played at the Mount Penn &quot;A&quot; field.  I miss the Sycamore in the front of the house, and the converted garage-turned-playroom.  When Matt came to New Hampshire, we probably played in the back yard. My earliest memory of Allie is her recording of Matt doing the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.  Her comment caption was, &quot;wet teeshirt contest.&quot;  This moment explains my love for Her.  An indefatigable ability to shred my cousin with humor, say something everyone might be thinking, and make it rain on him. <br/>";
				break;
				case 'Tim Malloy':
				var bodytext = "I first met Matt at Wyomissing high school where Matt and I both graduated in 2004. Throughout high school we were teammates on the soccer team, teammates on the tennis team and even made a run for the county title in doubles together eventually losing in what I remember as epic fashion. <br/><br/>We both decided to go to Penn State and Matt was the one that talked me into joining the sigma chi fraternity our first semester at school. While that decision may not have been the best decision for my grades it certainly was the best decision in terms of the amount of fun we had in college. Matt was obviously mostly responsible for a lot of that fun whether it was running the entire fraternities social calendar to acting as master DJ for every single get together I ever showed up to in college.  There are not many great memories from college and high school that do not involve Matt in one way or another. <br/><br/>Matt and I have become even better friends since high school and college and I am always looking forward to the next big golf weekend or ski trip or whatever Matt is planning with all of our friends. <br/><br/>I first met Allie at dinner in D.C. Where my wife and I joined a bunch of our other friends for dinner including Matt and Allie.  Everyone that knows my wife knows that she has been friends with Matt even longer than I have and when we knew we were going to be meeting matts new girlfriend we were ready to test her for sure. It was obvious that Allie was pretty awesome and we instantly thought she was great. Throughout the time we lived in D.C. We spent a lot of time with Matt and Allie and have always had a great time.  It's obvious that Allie cares a great deal for her family and friends since  her and Matt were some of the first few people to visit us all the way from D.C. After each of our kids was born. <br/><br/>I am happy to be one of matts groomsman and am looking forward to a great party!";
				break;
				case 'Justin Bale':
				var bodytext = "Like most classic and timeless love stories, Allie and I met while drinking natty lite at a house party near OSU's campus. Actually...I'm sure we weren't drinking because we were underage and that would be inappropriate...anyway; our bond strengthened over Glee, Greek life and our matching sarcastic personalities. She apparently liked me enough to share a vacation and let me be her housemate for an entire summer. And I like her enough to listen to an entire car ride of singing from D.C. to the shore and back. Much to my grandmother's (continuing) chagrin, we won't be getting married but I can't think of a more amazing man to put up with us, Matt has to be that man if he can survive being trapped during a blizzard with 2 divas.";
				break;
				case 'Jessi Frend':
				var bodytext = "Allie and I met 28 years ago on February 13, 1989 and it was on that day that she made me a big sister. I am sure my parents were also pretty excited about this addition to our family but I was fairly certain she was all mine. What I didn't know at that moment and would quickly learn is that Allie wasn't going to be my dress-up doll. She was going to be her own genuine and unique self, the one to make us laugh, remind us of the most obscure memory down to every detail, and the one who loves and cares so deeply. I truly admire this about Allie--her compassion and concern for others is unmatched. I am certain the phrase &quot;all the feels&quot; was written with Allie in mind. Paired with that compassion is her sense of humor and confident warmth. Allie has never met a stranger! <br/><br/>As we grew older, I watched Allie identify and foster friendships with people who, like her, are committed to doing good while not taking themselves too seriously. In that vein, it was during the summer of 2013 that a new person had joined her band of merry travelers...and with a leading role! Once Tim and I met Matt, we knew they were perfect complements. He is the calm to her excitement, the ready laughter to her humor (as she is to his), the sous chef eager to attempt their next kitchen masterpiece, and the &quot;Uncle&quot; to her &quot;Aunt&quot;. Jack and Libby love few people more than their Aunt Allie and Uncle Matt and we are all so excited and honored to cheer them on and stand by their sides on their special day...and to clear the dance floor while they both tear it up! We love you, Allie and Matt.";

				var bodytext = "Alex and Allie, &#x201c;Double Al&#x201d; is what our parents call us. We met freshman year of high school and have been in each other&#x2019;s lives ever since. One of the things I love about our friendship is the ability to laugh at ourselves and at each other.  We have been lucky enough to travel with each other&#x2019;s families over the years, and it's always easy. We both have a great love for Ocean City, hers in New Jersey, mine in Maryland. Our mutual love for the beach has created some memorable trips and lots of laughs. A common theme here is laughter; Allie&#x2019;s sense of humor is only surpassed by her insane knowledge of sports, which I love. <br/><br/>LOOOOOOVE YOU!!!!!";

Love you! ";

While both of us enjoyed the swings and slides, we were in fact working as camp counselors. Between rounds of Red Light, Green Light and arts and crafts involving very questionable finger paint, a friendship formed. While life has taken us far from that playground in Ocean City, we have been fortunate to share a friendship based on the most important things in life- a love of Manco &amp; Manco pizza, Philadelphia sports, and car ride sing-a-longs.  I am so honored to celebrate Matt and Allie as they begin their life together!";

As my first cousin, we've shared nearly every Thanksgiving, a few Easters, and some awesome vacations together. He has taught me to say 'for sure', the joys of Amazon Prime, and arguably everything I know about my iPhone!  I am very thankful to have Matt as a cousin - he is the kindest, most thoughtful, and most generous person I know. I am thrilled to be a part of Matt and Allie&#x2019;s wedding and look forward to sharing more good memories with both of them. ";

				var bodytext = "Allie and I have known each other our whole lives. Well truthfully, since she's a little bit older than me it would be more accurate to say Allie has known me my whole life. Our parents are best friends, which means from the moment I was born we became the &quot;almost cousins.&quot; We have spent every summer together (in OCNJ), every New Year's Eve together, have gone on many memorable &quot;family&quot; vacations, and have always bonded over our love of the Eagles. Allie has often times been a source of encouragement, a constructive critic, a confidant, and a big sister. We have been there for each other through the best of times and the worst of times. I can't wait to stand on Allie's side as she marries the love of her life - the newest addition to the &quot;almost cousins.&quot;";

				case 'Layne Starkey':
				var bodytext = "I met Allie met nearly 10 years ago when we both stepped foot on the greatest campus in the world, THE Ohio State University. We lived in the same dorm freshman year and were members of the same scholars group. Sophomore year, we made the crazy decision of living with 11 girls, and let me tell you, thank goodness Allie was one of those girls! We immediately bonded over our love for football, Celine dion, and the fact that we love belting out show tunes.  Our relationship was solidified when together we had the most epic halloween costume of all time: Wayne and Garth. Throughout the years, our relationship has only grown stronger. We may not live in the same state, but I still feel just as close to her as ever. Between the Harry Potter marathons, sticking to the &quot;hobbit diet,&quot; putting on performances, forever cheering on our beloved buckeyes, and the endless memories we have shared, I am so proud and excited to be standing by Allie's side as she marries the man of her dreams. I love you both.";

				var bodytext = "Allie and I have been close friends since we were 10 years old. With our pale yellow skirts, Doc Martins and mouths full of braces, we awkwardly stumbled upon each other in sixth grade at Holy Child.  Our friendship has transpired from field hockey practices, to all night Law and Order marathons, to dance parties in ol&#x2019; &#x201c;Tyrone,&#x201d; to countless date nights at Potomac Pizza. Allie has instilled in me the love for music and ranch dressing on my French fries. I couldn&#x2019;t be happier to be a part of Allie&#x2019;s and Matt&#x2019;s wedding! <br/>";
