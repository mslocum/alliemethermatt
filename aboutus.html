					<p><b>Allie:</b> <more>&#x201c;Thank the Lord I am a Philadelphia sports fan&#x201d; is something I&#x2019;ve never really thought because, for the most part, it means being on a emotional rollercoaster that often ends in defeat.  But I thought it to myself on March 15, 2013 when Matt came walking into Caddie&#x2019;s wearing a Phillies hat.  I immediately yelled at him that I loved the Phillies too and he smiled at me and let me awkwardly laugh and talk about my fandom.  After buying him a Guiness and  chatting a bit throughout the evening, I knew I would go home that night and stalk him on social media -- I am so glad I did.  Adding Matt on Facebook meant that he would then add me on every other platform (including LinkedIn because he is super professional after all). Most importantly, he decided to follow me on Spotify.  I guess you could say it was love at first playlist.</more></p>
					<p><b>Matt:</b> <more>Before I even got home, I had a friend request on Facebook. I thought Allie was super cute and very cool (although her knowledge of Philly sports was a little intimidating).  I wanted to play it cool... so I immediately added her on every social media account I owned.  Contrary to popular opinion, I don&#x2019;t think I actually added her on LinkedIn.  My best friends know that I pride myself on having all the latest music and best throw-backs.  Needless to say I was pretty impressed when I saw Allie&#x2019;s curated collection of Spotify playlists.  This gave me a good conversation starter which ultimately led to our first meet-up downtown in April.  We were both out with friends and decided to meet for a slice of pizza nearby.  I guess you could say it was love at first pizza.</more></p>

					<p><b>Allie:</b> <more>After our second date, I remember texting my friends and saying, &#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t imagine that if we keep dating, it won&#x2019;t be the real deal.&#x201d; I am VERY intuitive. Clearly. Maybe because both our first and second dates were six hours long because we kept talking and laughing.  I could be my true self around him and he seemed to enjoy it. I was an oversharer (per usual) and Matt wasn&#x2019;t too scared, but we could talk about anything - it was just so easy. We both loved sports, rollercoasters, Finding Nemo, 90&#x2019;s hip hop and dancing, and while those are great foundations, it was a relationship Matt had with someone else that made me realize that he was the guy for me. Matt and I had been dating for about 4 months and Jack&#x2019;s first birthday was approaching.  We invited Matt and he happily joined the festivities, even though the two hadn&#x2019;t met yet (and no offense to Mom, Dad, Jessi and Tim, but this was the real test).  Watching how quickly Matt took to my favorite human melted my heart.  The were instant buddies and I knew I wanted to spend as much time with this man as possible.  Jack fell in love with Matt as quickly as I did and a couple years later, I was blessed to watch Libby and Matt bond and it solidified every belief I had about the person Matt is. The way Matt loves Jack and Libby and the way they love him brings me the greatest joy in my life. </more></p>
					<p><b>Matt:</b> <more>If you can't tell by now, Allie's love for books and reading comes through in the way she sees and thinks of the world. Her relationships mean everything to her and she is thoughtful in ways that are normally reserved for a Nicholas Sparks novel.  During the first summer we were dating, Allie was away for the weekend and as a complete surprise, left me a care package she titled &quot;Matt's Chill Weekend&quot;. She left me a note containing instructions to drink gatoride to replenish my electrolytes, Sunglasses to go get some sun, some chamomile tea to relax, a few light books, Haribo Golden Bears (a personal favorite), and instructions to get some sleep. This very thoughtful gesture was something that most would say is above and beyond, but for Allie it was standard. Over the coming year, I noticed Allie instinctively go above and beyond putting in time and effort to care for those around her. Her selflessness and love for family quickly became my favorite qualities about her and made me realize the amazing friend, wife, and mother she will become.</more></p>

					<p><b>Allie:</b> <more>My formal training may be that I have seen every episode of Law &amp; Order and Criminal Minds, but I am basically a detective.  Therefore, I have to give Matt a ton of credit for surprising me with his proposal. Yes, Matt threw off Detective Taffy Girl. I knew it was coming soon because Matt is not a great secret keeper - which is actually a quality you want in a spouse - and he was getting a little antsy, but he masterfully planned a diversion with my family.  With the help of Mom and Dad, he and I were sent to Shriver&#x2019;s on the boardwalk to pick up (the best) Salt Water Taffy for a party we were going to.  For those who don&#x2019;t know, being late to anything gives me great anxiety - I&#x2019;d rather not show up at all than be late - and once Matt and I had picked out the taffy box we would give to the hosts at the party, Matt wanted to meander through the store to get some taffy for himself.  He was met with some &#x201c;Move with purpose, Matthew&#x201d; and &#x201c;you&#x2019;re taking too long&#x201d; lines as we reached the back of the store.  Matt kept telling me to look through the glass to the back room, to which he was met with, &#x201c;Matt, I worked here growing up! Mommom worked here! I&#x2019;ve been here every summer since birth! It&#x2019;s where they make the taffy! It&#x2019;s where they box the taffy! DAD IS WAITING FOR US!&#x201d;  After much persistence, I finally looked through the glass and saw the poster: For his first (and only) round draft pick, Matthew Slocum chooses Allison Williams.  Allie, will you marry me? I could barely mutter the yes through the tears, as Matt was on his knee next to me.  It was then when I heard the applause that I realized that I was the only one who didn&#x2019;t know what was coming while the crowd around us did.  We went home and celebrated the only way I wanted: with our families.</more></p>
					<p><b>Matt:</b> <more>Allie's detective skills scare me. I am always leery that she'll notice I ate one of her yogurts or popsicles.  I don't do this anymore.  That's why I made it my life's mission to make my proposal a surprise.  I went through the normal first thoughts, maybe a hot air balloon or on an exotic island... I quickly came to the conclusion that the thing that would mean the most to Allie is being in a place with her favorite memories. Ocean City is Allie's happy place and I immediately fell in love with it too.  From Beach House, to the boardwalk, Cathy's creme-filled donuts, and Kessel's milkshakes, I could tell this place was made for summer's as a kid. My favorite place was Shriver's salt water taffy.  Mostly because it is delicious, but also because of how special it is to Allie. I worked with Allie's parents to come up with an elaborate scheme to surprise her. They doctored a seven-layer deep email chain to create a fake dinner party as the context to send us to Shriver's. Any fewer emails and our cover would have been blown. My parents helped me come up with the sign - we figured she couldn't say no an Eagles' football themed proposal. The rest of the night was spent telling stories and celebrating with our families and of course eating all of the taffy we bought.</more></p>
